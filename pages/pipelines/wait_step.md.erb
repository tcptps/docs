# Wait step

A *wait* step waits for all previous steps to have successfully completed before allowing following jobs to continue.

{:toc}

A wait step can be defined in your pipeline settings, or in your [pipeline.yml](/docs/pipelines/uploading-pipelines) file. It can be placed between steps to ensure that previous steps are successful before continuing to run the rest.

```yml
- command: "command.sh"
- wait
- command: "echo The command passed"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

_Optional attributes:_

<table data-attributes>
  <tr>
    <td><code>continue_on_failure</code></td>
    <td>
      Run the next step, even if the previous step has failed.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>true</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>if</code></td>
    <td>
      A boolean expression that omits the step when false. See <a href="/docs/pipelines/conditionals">Using conditionals</a> for supported expressions.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>build.message != "skip me"</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>depends_on</code></td>
    <td>
      A list of step keys that this step depends on. This step will only proceed after the named steps have completed. See <a href="/docs/pipelines/dependencies">managing step dependencies</a> for more information.<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>"test-suite"</code>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><code>allow_dependency_failure</code></td>
    <td>
      Whether to continue to proceed past this step if any of the steps named in the <code>depends_on</code> attribute fail.<br>
      <em>Default:</em> <code>false</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Conditional wait

You can use a conditional to only wait when certain conditions are met:

```yml
steps:
  - wait: ~
    if: build.branch == "develop" || build.branch == "main"
```

## Continuing on failure

You can also configure the wait step to continue even if the previous steps failed. If steps failed, the build will be marked as failed only after any steps after the `wait` with `continue_on_failure: true` have completed.

This is useful for processing results from previous steps, for example, test coverage or summarizing test failures. Successful steps that run after a `continue_on_failure` step will not affect the status of the build; if there has been a failure, the build will be marked as failed.

In the example below, if `command.sh` succeeds, both of the following command steps will be run. If `command.sh` fails, only the first will be run, and the build will then be marked as failed.

```yml
steps:
  - command: "command.sh"
  - wait: ~
    continue_on_failure: true
  - command: "echo This runs regardless of the success or failure"
  - wait
  - command: "echo The command passed"
```

If there's a failure followed by a regular wait step, nothing after the wait step will run, including any subsequent wait steps with `continue_on_failure: true`. In the example below, when the first command fails, the second and third commands will not run:

```yml
steps:
  - command: "exit -1"
  - wait
  - command: "echo SECOND command"
  - wait: ~
    continue_on_failure: true
  - command: "echo THIRD command"
```

Any wait steps with `continue_on_failure: true` that aren't separated by regular wait steps will all run if a failure occurs. In the below example, after the first command fails, the second, third, and fourth commands will all run:

```yml
steps:
  - command: "exit -1"
  - wait: ~
    continue_on_failure: true
  - command: "echo SECOND command"
  - command: "echo THIRD command"
  - wait: ~
    continue_on_failure: true
  - command: "echo FOURTH command"
```

The explicit null `~` character used in the above examples isn't required, but is recommended as a best practice. It ensures that nothing else is accidentally added to the `wait` before the `continue_on_failure` attribute.
