# Upgrading your Buildkite Agents

Upgrade your Agents using your operating system package manager, or by re-running the installation script.

## Upgrading from 3.0-beta to a stable 3.0 agent

To upgrade a _Ubuntu / Debian_ 3.0 beta agent:

* Edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/buildkite-agent.list` and replace the word `unstable` (or `experimental`) with `stable`
* Run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y buildkite-agent`

To upgrade a _Red Hat / CentOS_ 3.0 beta agent:

* Edit `/etc/yum.repos.d/buildkite-agent.repo` and replace the word `unstable` (or `experimental`) with `stable`
* Run `sudo yum clean expire-cache && sudo yum update buildkite-agent`

If you didn't install the agent using the above packages, update the agent like you did originally and you will get the latest stable version.

## Upgrading from a 2.0 agent

To upgrade, install the new 3.0 agent using one of the [standard installation methods](/docs/agent/v3/installation). To make installation easier, there are packages for each of the major operating systems.

You can test your updated agents in parallel to your existing agents by using agent tags to create a new queue for 3.0 builds.

## Overview of what has changed in Agent v3

Added:

* [Plugins](/docs/plugins) for sharing functionality between pipelines and customizing how agents behave
* [Variable interpolation](/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline) in `pipeline.yml`
* [Build annotations](/docs/agent/v3/cli-annotate)
* [pre-exit hook](/docs/agent/v3/hooks#available-hooks)

Changed:

* Agent meta-data has been renamed to "tags"
* Much better Windows support, including .BAT hooks support
* Checkout clean no longer ignores files in `.gitignore`
* The bootstrap (run as a sub-process for every job) has moved from a [shell script](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/blob/2-6-stable/templates/bootstrap.sh) to [`buildkite-agent bootstrap`](/docs/agent/v3/cli-bootstrap). This means it's written in golang and cross-platform.

Deprecated:

* Built-in [Docker and Docker Compose support](/docs/tutorials/docker-containerized-builds) has been deprecated. The same functionality is available from the dedicated plugins: [docker-compose](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin) and [docker](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin).

### Bootstrap customizations

If you customized your `bootstrap.sh` file, you will need to move the changes to [hooks](/docs/agent/v3/hooks), or update your bootstrap.sh to call `buildkite-agent bootstrap`.

### Docker and Docker Compose support

In v2 we supported a variety of environment variables like `BUILDKITE_DOCKER_COMPOSE_CONTAINER` and `BUILDKITE_DOCKER`. These are deprecated in favour of the [docker-compose](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin) and [docker](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin) pipeline plugin.

You can keep using the old environment variables in v3, but they will be removed in v4.

#### Steps using `BUILDKITE_DOCKER_COMPOSE_CONTAINER`

This is a step that uses the v2 `BUILDKITE_DOCKER_COMPOSE_CONTAINER` environment variable to run the command in a docker-compose container:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ':hammer: Tests'
    command: 'scripts/tests.sh'
    env:
      BUILDKITE_DOCKER_COMPOSE_CONTAINER: app
```

The same action with the [docker-compose plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin) looks like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ':hammer: Tests'
    command: 'scripts/tests.sh'
    plugins:
      - docker-compose#v1.8.4:
          run: app
```

#### Steps using `BUILDKITE_DOCKER`

This is a step that uses the v2 `BUILDKITE_DOCKER` environment variable to run the command in docker container:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ':hammer: Tests'
    command: 'scripts/tests.sh'
    env:
      BUILDKITE_DOCKER: true
```

There isn't a direct conversion for this at present. You can either add a docker-compose file and use the [docker-compose plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin), or if you want to run your build in a docker container without providing a `Dockerfile` or a `docker-compose` file, you can use the [docker plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin):

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ':hammer: Tests'
    command: 'scripts/tests.sh'
    plugins:
      - docker#v1.1.1:
          image: "node:7"
          workdir: /app
```

### Environment variables in your pipeline.yml

Previously we didn't support environment variable interpolation, such as `${MY_VARIABLE_NAME}` or `$MY_VARIABLE_NAME`. If you have any of these in your `pipeline.yml`, they will now be interpolated. To render the literal text, you will need to escape the dollar signs, for example `$$MY_VARIABLE_NAME`.

See the [environment variable substitution](/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline#environment-variable-substitution) for more details.

### Checkout clean no longer ignores files in `.gitignore`

Older agents didn't remove files from your working directory that were ignored by git. The new default values for git clean are `-fxdq`. If you've previously overridden your `git-clean-flags` in your config, it might be a good chance to comment them out and use the standard behavior.
