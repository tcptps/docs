# Your own collectors

{:notoc}

Test Analytics integrates directly with your test runner to provide in-depth information about your tests (including spans) in real time.

If you can't find your framework in these pages, check the list of frameworks that are [coming soon](/docs/test-analytics/other-collectors), or if you're interested in building your own fully integrated analytics collector for specific test runners, have a look at our [example collector](https://github.com/buildkite/rspec-buildkite-analytics) on GitHub.
