# Artifactory

There are many ways to use [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) with Buildkite. This document covers how to configure the Buildkite Agent's built-in Artifactory support, as well as how to use Artifactory's package management features in your Buildkite pipelines.

## Buildkite Agent's Artifactory support

The Buildkite Agent can upload and download artifacts directly from Artifactory. Export the following environment variables in your [Agent environment hook](/docs/agent/v3/hooks) to configure the Agent's Artifactory support.

See the [Managing pipeline secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) documentation for how to securely set up these environment variables.

_Required environment vars:_

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_DESTINATION</code></td>
    <td>
      The Artifactory repository and path that will be used to upload and download artifacts, starting with an rt:// prefix<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>"rt://some-repo/build-$BUILDKITE_BUILD_NUMBER/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID/"</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_URL</code></td>
    <td>
      Your Artifactory instance URL, including the <code>/artifactory</code> suffix<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>https://my-artifactory-server/artifactory</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_USER</code></td>
    <td>
      The username of a user configured in your Artifactory instance<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>some-user</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD</code></td>
    <td>
      The <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Updating+Your+Profile#UpdatingYourProfile-APIKey">API Key</a>, <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/ACC/Access+Tokens#AccessTokens-UsingTokens">Access Token</a>, or password for your Artifactory user<br>
      <em>Example:</em> <code>AKCp5dKiQ9syTzu9GFhpF3iTzDcFhYAa4...</code><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Once the above environment variables are configured, all artifact uploads and downloads will use Artifactory. For example, the following [command step](/docs/pipelines/command-step) will build a binary and upload it to Artifactory using the `artifact_paths` attribute:

```yml
steps:
  - label: "\:golang\: \:package\:"
    command: "go build -v -o myapp-darwin-amd64"
    artifact_paths: "myapp-darwin-amd64"
    plugins:
      - docker#v3.3.0:
          image: "golang:1.11"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

## Using Artifactory for package management

To help cache and secure your build dependencies, you can use [Artifactory's package management](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Package+Management) features in your Buildkite pipelines. Each package management platform is configured differently.

For example, to use an [Artifactory NPM registry](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/npm+Registry?src=sidebar) in your build steps, you can configure the following [Agent environment hook](/docs/agent/v3/hooks) to instruct the [npm command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) to use Artifactory instead of npmjs.com:

```bash
export NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY="https://${BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_USER}:${BUILDKITE_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD}@my-artifactory-server/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/"
```

You can use this same approach for [Ruby gem repositories](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/RubyGems+Repositories), [Docker registries](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Docker+Registry), and any other Artifactory supported package managers.

If you're running build steps in a Docker container, you'll need to ensure the package management configuration is available inside the container. For example, if you're testing Node in a container, you'll need to pass through the above `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY` environment variable into the container:

```yml
steps:
  - label: "\:node\: \:hammer\:"
    commands:
      - npm install
      - npm test
    plugins:
      docker#v3.3.0:
        image: "node:11"
        environment:
          - NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}
