If you want to integrate the same repository into multiple Buildkite organizations, you need to link each organization to GitHub using different Buildkite user accounts. You must use different user accounts because there's a one-to-one relationship between a Buildkite user and a GitHub user. The user needs admin permissions on the GitHub organization to link it to Buildkite. You can only install the Buildkite app for GitHub once per GitHub organization.
